# ManagedBass.Hybrid

This is a PCL version of ManagedBass supposed to run everywhere.  
As a resuly ManagedBass can now work with Windows Store.

**NEW**: Every library is named the same as ManagedBass.dll.  
This brings in the Bait and Switch PCL trick.

Any and every Platform-specific things have been excluded.  
Notably, `ID3v2Tag` and `WaveFileWriter` are not included.
